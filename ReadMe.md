Smallest Federated Wiki
=======================

We're hosting development of a new federated wiki on GitHub.
The source code for several server implementations and a shared client-side application can be found here:

Federated Wiki Homepage
=======================

As we begin to trust these new servers we will host our documentation within them.
This project starts that move.
You can read these pages in their natural environment:

* http://fed.wiki.org

It is possible for you to fork this project and host it in your own federated wiki site.
Should you make documentation changes you think that I should see, I will review GitHub pull requests.
I look forward to the day when such backdoor wiki sharing would be plain silly.
Today I'm glad to show that our server flat files are in some useful sense compatible with git.
